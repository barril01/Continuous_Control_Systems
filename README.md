In problem 2-22a, the problem statement was to solve the differential equation using the Laplace transform.  Unfortunately, you only took the problem halfway and stopped at F(s).  In the end, the correct answer is: f(t) = [ (e^-t)/3 - (e^-2t)/2 + (e^-4t)/6]*us(t). -5 pts

Professors Comment:
In problem #2, there are 8 loops:

L11=-G2G3G4G5H2
L21=-G5G6H1
L31=-G8H1
L41=-G7H2G2
L51=-G4H4
L61=-G1G2G3G4G5G6H3
L71=-G1G2G7G6H3
L81=-G1G2G3G4G8H3

There are 3 pairs of non-touching loops in this problem:

L5L4=(-G4H4)(-G7H2G2)
L5L7=(-G4H4_(-G1G2G7G6H3)
L3L4=(-G8H1)(-G7H2G2)
